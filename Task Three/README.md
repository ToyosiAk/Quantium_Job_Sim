# Task 3: Analytics and commercial application
- Use your analytics and insights from Task 1 and 2 to prepare a report for your client, the Category Manager.

- With our project coming to an end its time for us to send a report to Julia, based on our analytics from the previous tasks. We want to provide her with insights and recommendations that she can use when developing the strategic plan for the next half year.

- As best practice at Quantium, we like to use the “Pyramid Principles” framework when putting together a report for our clients. If you are not already familiar with this framework you can find quick introductions on by searching form them on the internet.

- For this report, we need to include data visualisations, key callouts, insights as well as recommendations and/or next steps.
